This project is currently a toy project to explore Nix and Nix modules.  
For now, I am attempting to replicate the functionality of [services-flake](https://github.com/juspay/services-flake).  
I highly recommend using [services-flake](https://github.com/juspay/services-flake) to run all your services locally.
